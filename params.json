To avoid that:-\r\n\r\n`nmap -sS -p 80,443 <network-address>/<subnet>`\r\n\r\n* S-> Stealthy (SYN Scan; Half-open)\r\n\r\nRather than **3-way** handshake it's just **SYN,SYN-ACK**\r\n\r\n##### How to find which OS is being used by the target server?\r\n\r\n`nmap -O <server-ip>`\r\n\r\n#### How to find the OS, version, scan script and traceroute?\r\n\r\n`nmap -A <server-ip>`\r\n\r\n#### Decoy (-D), using this will generate traffic not only from your laptop but from another src.ip which you mention in the command below, the destination won't know who is actually sending this traffic\r\n\r\n`nmap -sS -D <Src.ip> <Dest.ip>`\r\n\r\n#### Write custom scripts for nmap\r\n\r\n[Scripts](nmap.org/nsedoc/categories/vuln.html)\r\n\r\nvuln (uses any script under the above link category)\r\n\r\n`nmap --script vuln <host>`","note":"Don't delete this file!
